### Summary
 This project uses multiple 360 videos shot from the viewpoint of objects around my house. I was interested in the personification of inanimate objects to viewers and set out to explore their perception of the world through this project. Each object is one that I use often - objects that I should get to know better. This project puts viewers into the headspace of these objects in my apartment watchingwatching the world in the position and in the way they are used to. Users will interact with this project through 360 youtube videos using an iPad. This way, users will be forced to move around as they view the space, thereby, becoming an active member in the peice. <br>
 The data presented in this project is second to the actual experience of the piece. I feel the largest point of interest for me is actually experiencing the world from the head of objects which I use on a daily basis.

### Potential VR 
 In the best case scenario, these videos will be available for viewers to watch using a google cardboard- they will be able to use Youtube’s new feature which allows 360 videos to be experienced in VR using compatible phones. Currently, the list of compatible phones that will allow this piece to be experienced in the way it was supposed to is small. However, more phones are projected to be able to use this technology and Apple seems to have plans to allow their phones to work with this technology. Until then, though, the piece is best viewed on a smart tablet like the iPad where viewers can move the iPad (viewport) around themselves to experience the piece. Moving the iPad gives a glimpses of the physicality this piece will ideally have with google cardboard.

### Reflection
A large amount of this project was trying to get the 360 camera to connect with my iPhone, trying to pretend there was no camera where I knew there was, and trying to find ways to use youtube’s new VR capabilities with the materials I could get my hands on. In the end, I had to settle for using an iPad, however, I’m confident the piece can be experienced in google cardboard in the near future as Google works to drive out it’s compatibility issues.
