###What is it?
The skanect is a easy to use attachment for an ipad. The hardware allows you to use your ipad's camera to scan various items as 
well as full rooms. The program requires 4 apps - the skanect scanner, fetch, room capture, and viewer.

Each application is good for it's ow thing. The "Room Capture" application allows you to, obviously, capture an entire room. 
The "Scanner" app allows you to scan normal 3D objects. The "Fetch" application allows you to scan part of the real world in 3D and 
use it in real time in a game environment using a unity plugin allowing experiemnts with augmented reality adn VR.

###Scanning an object using the scanner app
######A method to get quick scans with small effort
<br><br><br>
1) Place the object you are scanning on a clean surface so that the scanner has an easier time identifying what you want to scan
<br><br>
2) Open the "scanner" app on the ipad and plug in the skanect scanner. 
<br><br>
3) You should see a white line box on your display. Make sure it is colored red and your item is in the middle of the box. Click "Scan"
<br><br>
4) The app should start creating a mesh based on what it sees. Hold your ipad at the same spot to get a more accurate read.
<br><br>
5) Start moving around and above your object slowly trying to fill in all teh gaps in the mesh and pausing when the app prompts you to.
<br><br>
6) After finishing, Hit the scan button again to finish your scan. You will then be able to view your scan with colors, without colors, and with only polygons.
<br><br>
7) Hit the email button at the top right corner to email your scan to yourself! You're done!
